# # [False Sharing](@id FalseSharing)
#
# *False Sharing* is a very common but subtle performance issue that comes up again and
# again when writing parallel code manually. For this reason, we shall discuss what it is
# about and how to avoid it.
#
# For simplicity, let's focus on a specific example: parallel summation.
#
# ## Baseline: sequential summation
#
# To establish a baseline, that we can later compare against, we define some fake data,
# which we'll sum up, and benchmark Julia's built-in, non-parallel `sum` function.

using Base.Threads: nthreads
using BenchmarkTools
using ThreadPinning #hide
pinthreads(:cores) #hide

data = rand(1_000_000 * nthreads());
@btime sum($data);

#
# ## The problematic parallel implementation
#
# A conceptually simple (and valid) approach to parallelizing the summation is to divide
# the full computation into parts. Specifically, the idea is to divide the data into chunks,
# compute the partial sums of these chunks in parallel, and finally sum up the partial
# results. (Note that we will not concern ourselves with potential minor or
# catastrophic numerical errors due to potential rearrangements of terms in the summation here.)
#
# A common, manual implementation of this idea might look like this:

using OhMyThreads: @spawn, chunks

function parallel_sum_falsesharing(data; nchunks = nthreads())
    psums = zeros(eltype(data), nchunks)
    @sync for (i, chunk) in enumerate(chunks(data; n = nchunks))
        @spawn begin
            for x in chunk
                psums[i] += x
            end
        end
    end
    return sum(psums)
end

# The code is pretty straightforward: We allocate space for the results of the partial sums
# (`psums`) and, on `nchunks` many tasks, add up the data elements of each partial sum in
# parallel. More importantly, and in this context perhaps surprisingly, the code is also
# **correct** in the sense that it produces the desired result.

using Test
@test sum(data) â‰ˆ parallel_sum_falsesharing(data)

# This is just a reflection of the fact that there is no logical sharing of data - because
# each parallel tasks modifies a different element of `psums` - implying the absence of
# race conditions.
#
# What's the issue then?! Well, the sole purpose of parallelization is to reduce runtime.
# So let's see how well we're doing in this respect.

nthreads()

#

@btime parallel_sum_falsesharing($data);

# A **slowdown**?! Clearly, that's the opposite of what we tried to achieve!

#
# ## The issue: False sharing
#
# Although our parallel summation above is semantically correct, it has a
# big **performance issue**: *False sharing*. To understand false sharing, we have to think
# a little bit about how computers work. Specifically, we need to realize that processors
# cache memory in lines (rather than individual elements) and that caches of different processors
# are kept coherent.
# When two (or more) different CPU cores operate on independent data elements that **fall
# into the same cache line** (i.e. they are part of the same memory address region)
# the **cache coherency mechanism leads to costly synchronization** between cores.

# In our case, this happens despite the fact that different parallel tasks
# (on different CPU cores) *logically* don't care about the rest of the data in the cache line
# at all.

# ![](false_sharing.svg)

# Given these insights, we can come up with a few workarounds that mitigate the issue.
# The most prominent is probably padding, where one simply adds sufficiently many unused
# zeros to `psums` such that different partial sum counters don't fall into the same cache
# line. However, let's discuss a more fundamental, more efficient, and more elegant solution.

#
# ## Task-local parallel summation
#
# The key mistake in `parallel_sum_falsesharing` above is the non-local modification of
# (implicitly) shared state (cache lines of `psums`) very frequently (in the innermost loop).
# We can simply avoid this by making the code more task-local. To this end, we introduce a
# **task-local accumulator variable**, which we use to perform the task-local partial sums.
# Only at the very end do we communicate the result to the main thread, e.g. by writing it
# into `psums` (once!).

function parallel_sum_tasklocal(data; nchunks = nthreads())
    psums = zeros(eltype(data), nchunks)
    @sync for (i, chunk) in enumerate(chunks(data; n = nchunks))
        @spawn begin
            local s = zero(eltype(data))
            for x in chunk
                s += x
            end
            psums[i] = s
        end
    end
    return sum(psums)
end

@test sum(data) â‰ˆ parallel_sum_tasklocal(data)
@btime parallel_sum_tasklocal($data);

# Finally, there is a speed up! ðŸŽ‰
#
# Two comments are in order.
#
# First, we note that the only role that `psums` plays is
# as a temporary storage for the results from the parallel tasks to be able to sum them
# up eventually. We could get rid of it entirely by using a `Threads.Atomic` instead which
# would get updated via `Threads.atomic_add!` from each task directly. However,
# for our discussion, this is a detail and we won't discuss it further.
#
# Secondly, while keeping the general idea, we can drastically simplify the above code by
# using `map` and reusing the built-in (sequential) `sum` function on each parallel task:

function parallel_sum_map(data; nchunks = nthreads())
    ts = map(chunks(data, n = nchunks)) do chunk
        @spawn sum(chunk)
    end
    return sum(fetch.(ts))
end

@test sum(data) â‰ˆ parallel_sum_map(data)
@btime parallel_sum_map($data);

# This implementation is conceptually
# clearer in that there is no explicit modification of shared state, i.e. no `pums[i] = s`,
# anywhere at all. We can't run into false sharing if we don't modify shared state ðŸ˜‰.
#
# Note that since we use the built-in `sum` function, which is highly optimized, we might see
# better runtimes due to other effects - like SIMD and the absence of bounds checks - compared
# to the simple for-loop accumulation in `parallel_sum_tasklocal` above.

#
# ## Parallel summation with OhMyThreads
#
# Finally, all of the above is abstracted away for you if you simply use [`treduce`](@ref)
# to implement the parallel summation. It also only takes a single line and function call.

using OhMyThreads: treduce

@test sum(data) â‰ˆ treduce(+, data; ntasks = nthreads())
@btime treduce($+, $data; ntasks = $nthreads());
