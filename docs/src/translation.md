# [Translation Guide](@id TG)

This page tries to give a general overview of how to translate patterns written with the built-in tools of [Base.Threads](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/multi-threading/) using the [OhMyThreads.jl API](@ref API). Note that this should be seen as a rough guide and (intentionally) isn't supposed to replace a systematic introduction into OhMyThreads.jl.


## Basics

### `@threads`

```julia
# Base.Threads
using Base.Threads: @threads

@threads for i in 1:10
    println(i)
end
```

```julia
# OhMyThreads
using OhMyThreads: @tasks

@tasks for i in 1:10
    println(i)
end

# or
using OhMyThreads: tforeach

tforeach(1:10) do i
    println(i)
end
```

#### `:static` scheduling

```julia
# Base.Threads
using Base.Threads: @threads

@threads :static for i in 1:10
    println(i)
end
```

```julia
# OhMyThreads
using OhMyThreads: @tasks

@tasks for i in 1:10
    @set scheduler=:static
    println(i)
end

# or
using OhMyThreads: tforeach

tforeach(1:10; scheduler=:static) do i
    println(i)
end
```

### `@spawn`

```julia
# Base.Threads
using Base.Threads: @spawn

@sync for i in 1:10
    @spawn println(i)
end
```

```julia
# OhMyThreads
using OhMyThreads: @tasks

@tasks for i in 1:10
    @set chunking=false
    println(i)
end

# or
using OhMyThreads: tforeach

tforeach(1:10; chunking=false) do i
    println(i)
end

# or
using OhMyThreads: @spawn

@sync for i in 1:10
    @spawn println(i)
end
```

## Reduction

No built-in feature in Base.Threads.

```julia
# Base.Threads: basic manual implementation
using Base.Threads: @spawn

data = rand(10)
chunks_itr = Iterators.partition(data, length(data) รท nthreads())
tasks = map(chunks_itr) do chunk
    @spawn reduce(+, chunk)
end
reduce(+, fetch.(tasks))
```

```julia
# OhMyThreads
using OhMyThreads: @tasks
data = rand(10)

@tasks for x in data
    @set reducer=+
end

# or
using OhMyThreads: treduce

treduce(+, data)
```

## Mutation

!!! warning
    Parallel mutation of non-local state, like writing to a shared array, can be the source of correctness errors (e.g. race conditions) and big performance issues (e.g. [false sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_sharing#:~:text=False%20sharing%20is%20an%20inherent,is%20limited%20to%20RAM%20caches.)). You should carefully consider whether this is necessary or whether the use of [thread-safe storage](@ref TSS) is the better option. **We don't recommend using the examples in this section for anything serious!**

```julia
# Base.Threads
using Base.Threads: @threads
data = rand(10)

@threads for i in 1:10
    data[i] = calc(i)
end
```

```julia
# OhMyThreads
using OhMyThreads: @tasks
data = rand(10)

@tasks for i in 1:10
    data[i] = calc(i)
end

# or
using OhMyThreads: tforeach

tforeach(data) do i
    data[i] = calc(i)
end

# or
using OhMyThreads: tmap!

tmap!(data, data) do i # this kind of aliasing is fine
    calc(i)
end
```

## Parallel initialization

!!! warning
    Parallel mutation of non-local state, like writing to a shared array, can be the source of correctness errors (e.g. race conditions) and big performance issues (e.g. [false sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_sharing#:~:text=False%20sharing%20is%20an%20inherent,is%20limited%20to%20RAM%20caches.)). You should carefully consider whether this is necessary or whether the use of [thread-safe storage](@ref TSS) is the better option. **We don't recommend using the examples in this section for anything serious!**

```julia
# Base.Threads
using Base.Threads: @threads

data = Vector{Float64}(undef, 10)
@threads for i in 1:10
    data[i] = calc(i)
end
```

```julia
# OhMyThreads
using OhMyThreads: @tasks

data = @tasks for i in 1:10
    @set collect=true
    calc(i)
end

# or
using OhMyThreads: tmap

data = tmap(i->calc(i), 1:10)

# or
using OhMyThreads: tcollect

data = tcollect(calc(i) for i in 1:10)
```
