# OhMyThreads

#### This package is in very early development and is not yet registered

This is meant to be a simple, unambitious package that provides user-friendly ways of doing task-parallel
multithreaded calculations via higher-order functions, with a focus on
[data parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_parallelism) without needing to expose julia's
[Task](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/parallel/) model to users.

Unlike most JuliaFolds2 packages, it is not built off of
[Transducers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFolds2/Transducers.jl), nor is it a building block for Transducers.jl.
Rather, OhMyThreads is meant to be a simpler, more maintainable, and more accessible alternative to packages
like [ThreadsX.jl](https://github.com/tkf/ThreadsX.jl) or [Folds.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFolds2/Folds.jl).

OhMyThreads.jl re-exports the function `chunks` from
[ChunkSplitters.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFolds2/ChunkSplitters.jl), and provides the following functions:

<details><summary> tmapreduce </summary>
<p>

```
tmapreduce(f, op, A::AbstractArray...;
           [init],
           nchunks::Int = nthreads(),
           split::Symbol = :batch,
           schedule::Symbol =:dynamic,
           outputtype::Type = Any)
```

A multithreaded function like `Base.mapreduce`. Perform a reduction over `A`, applying a single-argument function `f` to each element, and then combining them with the two-argument function `op`. `op` **must** be an [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property) function, in the sense that `op(a, op(b, c)) ≈ op(op(a, b), c)`. If `op` is not (approximately) associative, you will get undefined results.

For a very well known example of `mapreduce`, `sum(f, A)` is equivalent to `mapreduce(f, +, A)`. Doing

```
 tmapreduce(√, +, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

is the parallelized version of

```
 (√1 + √2) + (√3 + √4) + √5
```

This data is divided into chunks to be worked on in parallel using [ChunkSplitters.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFolds2/ChunkSplitters.jl).

## Keyword arguments:

  * `init` optional keyword argument forwarded to `mapreduce` for the sequential parts of the calculation.
  * `nchunks::Int` (default `nthreads()`) is passed to `ChunkSplitters.chunks` to inform it how many pieces of data should be worked on in parallel. Greater `nchunks` typically helps with [load balancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)), but at the expense of creating more overhead.
  * `split::Symbol` (default `:batch`) is passed to `ChunkSplitters.chunks` to inform it if the data chunks to be worked on should be contiguous (:batch) or shuffled (:scatter). If `scatter` is chosen, then your reducing operator `op` **must** be [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property) in addition to being associative, or you could get incorrect results!
  * `schedule::Symbol` (default `:dynamic`), determines how the parallel portions of the calculation are scheduled. Options are one of

      * `:dynamic`: generally preferred since it is more flexible and better at load balancing, and won't interfere with other multithreaded functions which may be running on the system.
      * `:static`: can sometimes be more performant than `:dynamic` when the time it takes to complete a step of the calculation is highly uniform, and no other parallel functions are running at the same time.
      * `:greedy`: best option for load-balancing slower, uneven computations, but does carry some additional overhead. This schedule will read from the contents of `A` in a non-deterministic order, and thus your reducing `op` **must** be [commutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property) in addition to being associative, or you could get incorrect results! This schedule will however work with non-`AbstractArray` iterables. If you use the `:greedy` scheduler, we strongly recommend you provide an `init` keyword argument.
      * `:interactive`: like `:dynamic` but runs on the high-priority interactive threadpool. This should be used very carefully since tasks on this threadpool should not be allowed to run for a long time without `yield`ing as it can interfere with [heartbeat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_(computing)) processes running on the interactive threadpool.
  * `outputtype::Type` (default `Any`) will work as the asserted output type of parallel calculations. This is typically only

needed if you are using a `:static` schedule, since the `:dynamic` schedule is uses [StableTasks.jl](https://github.com/MasonProtter/StableTasks.jl), but if you experience problems with type stability, you may be able to recover it with the `outputtype` keyword argument.

<details><summary> treducemap </summary>
<p>

```
treducemap(op, f, A::AbstractArray...;
           [init],
           nchunks::Int = nthreads(),
           split::Symbol = :batch,
           schedule::Symbol =:dynamic,
           outputtype::Type = Any)
```

Like `tmapreduce` except the order of the `f` and `op` arguments are switched. This is sometimes convenient with `do`-block notation. Perform a reduction over `A`, applying a single-argument function `f` to each element, and then combining them with the two-argument function `op`. `op` **must** be an [associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property) function, in the sense that `op(a, op(b, c)) ≈ op(op(a, b), c)`. If `op` is not (approximately) associative, you will get undefined results.

For a very well known example of `mapreduce`, `sum(f, A)` is equivalent to `mapreduce(f, +, A)`. Doing

```
 treducemap(+, √, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

is the parallelized version of

```
 (√1 + √2) + (√3 + √4) + √5
```

```
tmap(f, [OutputElementType], A::AbstractArray...; 
     nchunks::Int = nthreads(),

```

A multithreaded function like `Base.map`. Create a new container `similar` to `A` whose `i`th element is equal to `f(A[i])`. This container is filled in parallel on multiple tasks. The optional argument `OutputElementType` will select a specific element type for the returned container, and will generally incur fewer allocations than the version where `OutputElementType` is not specified.
